Paper accepted for publication in the **Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (ACM TALLIP)!**

## The MILPaC Dataset 
<b> MILPaC </b> (**M**ultilingual **I**ndian **L**egal **Pa**rallel **C**orpus) is the first parallel corpus of legal text in Indian languages, consisting of 3 high-quality datasets (**MILPaC-IP**, **MILPaC-CCI-FAQ**, and **MILPaC-Acts**) compiled from reliable sources of legal information in India. It includes parallel text units in English and 9 Indian languages, covering Indo-Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Gujarati, & Oriya) and Dravidian (Tamil, Telugu, & Malayalam) languages, many of which are low-resource. MILPaC is designed to evaluate the performance of Machine Translation models in translating legal texts from English to Indian languages or between Indian languages.
